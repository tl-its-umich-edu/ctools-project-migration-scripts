# Configuration file for generating SQL to REMOVE/RESTORE permissions from
# specific sites / roles.

# The file format is yaml.  Copy and paste will work well for making new
# entries.  Just note that yaml is sensitive to indentation. Lines whose first
# non-whitespace character is a '#' are ignored.

# The set of permissions to be removed is the same for all sites and
# roles.  This needs to be specialized for different CTools instances,
# sets of sites to exclude and sets of sites to restore.

# Sites to be make read only are now chosen by site type.  Specific sites can be
# exempted by listing them below.  Sites to be restored need to have their
# site ids listed below.  More details are given later in the file.

# This is the table prefix for the SQL queries.  It will vary by database instance.

# Put in a line break for comma separated lists in IN clause every this many entries.

# Name of role / function archive table to be used for restoring permissions.  This
# value needs to be set each time a restoriation is done.  There may be multiple
# backup tables and someone needs to indentify the correct one.
# The table name format is 'sakai_realm_rl_fn_' with the date of table creation
# appended.  SQL to generate the backup table is created automatically along with the
# read only sql.

###################### list of special sites to restore / exempt

# Sometimes sites need to be listed explicitly by site id.  The site lists
# always contain a dummy siteid so that there is at least one.  (See if you can
# guess which one it is.)

# While the sites are obtained from the yml file the lists of sites
# are maintained in csv files. Those files are read at when the
# generateBatchROSqlSite.pl script is run to create a one-time yml file
# for the actual sql script creation.  The yml format is illustrated below
# but the user won't need to explicitly add the lists to the yml file. 

# Sites on the restoreSites list will have their permissions restored
# from the archive table specified elsewhere.  Remove sites on the
# list after they are processed so that permissions aren't restored by
# accident in a future run.

# restoreSites:
#     - ImJustADummySiteIdStringHAHAYouCantFindMe

# Sites on the list of excluded sites will not be made read-only.  If there are
# multiple runs of the script verify that the right sites continue to
# be on the list.  Some administrative sites should always be listed.
# E.g. the gateway admin site.  The list must have at least one entry
# so a dummy site should be included.

# Sample excluded Sites entry.  The real site ids are read from the
# exemptsites.csv file
