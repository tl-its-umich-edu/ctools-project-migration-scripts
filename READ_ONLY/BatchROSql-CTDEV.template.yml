# Configuration file for generating SQL to REMOVE/RESTORE permissions from
# specific sites / roles.

# The file format is yaml.  Copy and paste will work well for making new
# entries.  Just note that yaml is sensitive to indentation. Lines whose first
# non-whitespace character is a '#' are ignored.

# The set of permissions to be removed is the same for all sites and
# roles.  This needs to be specialized for different CTools instances,
# sets of sites to exclude and sets of sites to restore.

# Sites to be make read only are now chosen by site type.  Specific sites can be
# exempted by listing them below.  Sites to be restored need to have their
# site ids listed below.  More details are given later in the file.

# This is the table prefix for the SQL queries.  It will vary by database instance.
db_user: CTDEV_USER

########## These next 3 values are unlikely to change. #########
# Put in a line break for comma separated lists in IN clause every this many entries.

# Maximum number of realms to add to each query.
realms_max: 20
# Table used for logging actions.  Unlikely to change except when testing.

# Name of role / function archive table to be used for restoring permissions.  This
# value needs to be set each time a restoriation is done.  There may be multiple
# backup tables and someone needs to indentify the correct one.
# The table name format is 'sakai_realm_rl_fn_' with the date of table creation
# appended.  SQL to generate the backup table is created automatically along with the
# read only sql.

###################### Site lists

# Sometimes sites need to be listed explicitly by site id.  The site lists
# always contain a dummy siteid so that there is at least one.  (See if you can
# guess which one it is.)

# Sites on the excluded list will not be made read-only.  If there are
# multiple runs of the script verify that the right sites continue to
# be on the list.  Some administrative sites should always be listed.
# E.g. the gateway admin site.  The list must have at least one entry
# so a dummy site has been included.

excludedSites:
    - ImJustADummySiteIdStringHAHAYouCantFindMe
#     - 2003-mkt
#     - 2003-3-A-MAP-05
#     - gatewayadmin

# Sites on this list will have their permissions restored from the archive table
# specified elsewhere.  Remove sites on the list after they are processed so that
# permissions aren't restored by accident in a future run.
